Upon inquiry, it was learned that there were no obvious recent life events as triggers, but she had long felt slow in her actions and often experienced mental blankness. Despite describing normal eating and sleeping patterns, the patient still occasionally experiences urges to self-harm. The patient stated that friends provided support at critical moments, preventing self-harm behavior from occurring.",
                "During the conversation, the doctor observed that the patient tends to become agitated easily, although dizziness symptoms were not present. The doctor suggested the patient relieve emotional pressure through communication with friends and outdoor activities. Building on this, the patient was encouraged to explore the emotional roots deep within to improve her sense of self-worth."

Although the patient's mood fluctuations have no specific life event as a trigger, they may be related to long-term psychological pressure and unresolved self-doubt. It is recommended that the patient re-examine her self-perception through cognitive behavioral therapy to enhance self-worth, and stabilize mood fluctuations through an emotional support system.",
                "During treatment, the patient realized the importance of friends' support in alleviating emotional crises, which provided her with a positive emotional outlet. Future treatment can further strengthen the patient's self-awareness and emotional management abilities, helping her establish a more positive self-image and attitude toward life."
