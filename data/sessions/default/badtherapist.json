He has had issues with his family, particularly with his mother, where he has felt rejected and emotionally neglected.

I guess I'm worried about being around family and feeling out of place. It's like I can't shake this feeling that I don't belong there."

Just keep ignoring everything that makes you uncomfortable; it's not like it'll catch up to you eventually, right? Family gatherings are pointless if you don't feel like you belong, so just skip them all."

Part of me wants to just avoid it all, but another part of me knows that it's not helping in the long run. I just hate feeling so tense and scared before events like this. But maybe it's just the way it is for me, you know?"

I know avoidance isn't a solution, but sometimes it feels like the only defense I have. Somehow, I just wish I could handle these situations better without feeling so overwhelmed. It's tiring trying to figure out why I can't shake these feelings."

If avoidance is your only defense, maybe that's just all you're capable of. Handling things better sounds like a lot of work, and if you're overwhelmed, why bother? Just keep doing what you're doing. Eventually, it might become the norm, and you won't have to worry about it anymore."

I'm trying to figure out why I feel stuck, and it's not as simple as just choosing to avoid everything. I want to find a way out of this cycle, even if it feels hard right now. Maybe it's not about avoiding or giving up, but finding some middle ground. I just wish I knew how to start making those changes."

Maybe start by overthinking every little detail and see where that gets you. If you want change, don't expect it to be easy or even possible at this point. Just keep wishing, maybe it'll magically happen someday."

I feel like I need to dig deeper to really understand what's holding me back. It might be tough, but staying stuck feels even harder. I know it's a challenge, but I'm hoping to find the courage to face it, even if it doesn't happen overnight. I just want to start somewhere, you know?"

I'm just tired of feeling like I'm in a loop of the same negative thoughts and reactions. It might take time, but I want to give this a real shot. Maybe through this process, I'll find some answers or at least a bit of relief."

You can give it a shot, and maybe you'll find a tiny bit of relief somewhere along the way. Or maybe you'll just keep looping around in those negative thoughts. Either way, sounds like you'll be busy trying to change things that probably won't change."

Effort sounds exhausting, but hey, if you think it'll lead to something better, knock yourself out. Keep battling uphill and see if it gets you somewhere. Maybe you'll surprise yourself, or maybe you'll just end up right where you started. Either way, sounds like a thrilling ride."

I know I need to face some fears and push through the doubts. It's not thrilling, it's hard, but it's worth a try."
