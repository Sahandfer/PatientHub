We've touched on some important concerns with your sleep issues and work pressure, and I think we're beginning to uncover some patterns from your past that might be contributing to how you're feeling now. Would you be comfortable continuing to explore these connections between your work stress and sleep difficulties in our next session?"

It's just that, uh, talking about some of the past stuff feels a bit uncomfortable, but I see how it might help connect the dots with why I'm so messed up now... Um, but I’ll try to be more open next time. Maybe... Maybe that’ll make things a little clearer?"

Do you think it's normal to have such a hard time focusing lately? Like, every time I sit down to work, I feel like I can't process anything."
