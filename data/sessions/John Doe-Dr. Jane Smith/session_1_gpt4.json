Honestly, I'm feeling a bit nervous about being here, but I decided to come because I've been struggling with feeling overwhelmed and stressed, especially with work and deadlines. I thought maybe talking to someone might help me figure out how to handle things better."

I often feel like there's so much to do and not enough time, and I get stuck overthinking everything, which just makes it worse. It's been affecting my sleep and my ability to focus, and I sometimes feel like I'm not doing enough, even when I am."

When I approach tasks, I usually try to plan everything out in detail, but sometimes I get so caught up in trying to make things perfect that I end up procrastinating. Then, I feel even more stressed because I've lost time."

I've always felt like I need to do things perfectly, or else it's not good enough, and that feeling has been with me for as long as I can remember. It affects my daily life because I end up spending so much time on little details that I barely have energy for anything else."

As we wrap up today, I’d like to suggest that we explore strategies in future sessions to help manage these tendencies and find a balance that works for you."
