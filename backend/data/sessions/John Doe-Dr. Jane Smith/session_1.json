It focuses on the connections between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors – would you like me to walk through an example of how that might apply to a challenge you’re facing?"

Using CBT principles, they identified John's automatic thought ('I'm going to fail again') triggering physical tension and procrastination, which reinforced his negative self-belief. A partial success (meditation + task breakdown) revealed existing coping skills hindered by perfectionism. Homework involves a thought/behavior journal tracking small, manageable tasks paired with self-compassion practices.",

Document:\n   - Column 1: Initial thoughts (e.g., 'This is pointless')\n   - Column 2: Outcome (e.g., 'Completed 1 section')\n   - Optional: Note physical reactions or self-talk shifts.\n\n2. **Self-Compassion Reminder**: When avoidance occurs, write or mentally repeat: 'One step isn’t nothing.'\n\n3. **Review Worksheets**: Next session will use journal data to challenge cognitive distortions and adjust strategies."
